Sudoku Solver
============================================


*Author: Andrea Zubenko 

This project is a sudoku player created with logisim. It uses some custom components written in java, written to overcome some logisim's limitations **and** provide a better user interface (such as squared monitors).

To play, simply click on a cell and insert a number from the keyboard. The number will be displayed, and the system will tell you in real time if there's an error in the board or if you've won.

More detailed info about the internal circuitry can be found in the report (in Italian).
